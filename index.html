                An abstract is a <strong>summary or description of a longer paper</strong> and is a common feature
                of journal articles and research papers. An abstract allows a reader to quickly
                determine if the longer work is relevant to their research needs.

                        The contents of an abstract will depend on its purpose; refer to the assignment
                        directions for your instructor's requirements.

                Abstracts are typically <strong>short (150-250 words); student paper abstracts</strong> include some
                or all the following elements:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Purpose:</strong> A statement of what your paper seeks to accomplish. The purpose is
                    different than the thesis statement in that it does not give your specific argument,
                    but rather what you hope to accomplish by making that argument.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Context:</strong> Briefly explain how your ideas fit into already established conversations
                    about your topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Thesis:</strong> State the thesis statement from your paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Results/Conclusions:</strong> Explain conclusions you drew from your research. Be
                    specific but brief.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implications:</strong> Indicate what impact your paper might have in your field and/or
                    why readers should care about the topic of the paper.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong> In the following example, each sentence is numbered to correspond with the

                    <sup>1</sup>This paper calls attention to what has been previously overlooked as a significant form
                    of learning in public schools, specifically detailing how even a sport video game can
                    provide valuable educational experiences. <sup>2</sup>Although many scholars have recently
                    been focusing on the negative impacts of sports video games, <sup>3</sup>this paper argues,
                    alternatively, that such games improve students' problem-solving skills, inspire interest
                    in history and culture, and encourage independent questioning that helps develop the
                    mindset of a life-long learner.
                    <sup>4</sup>When teachers capitalize on these benefits, students
                    are in turn able to engage more fully in their own educational processes and thereby
                    learn more effectively.
                    <sup>5</sup>This outcome suggests that a shift in focus may be necessary
                    in educational research, moving away from person-to-person interactions and instead
                    focusing on person to screen interactions.
