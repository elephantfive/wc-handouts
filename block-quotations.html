                <p>
                    Nelly Dean treats Heathcliff poorly and dehumanizes him throughout her narration:
                    <p class="block-quote">
                        They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room, and I had
                        no more sense, so, I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it would be gone
                        on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr.
                        Earnshaw’s door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were
                        made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my
                        cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house. (Bronte 78)

            <h2>Important Note</h2>
            <em>
                When possible, keep direct quotations as brief as possible. Remove unnecessary
                portions of the quotation (as long as it does not change the meaning of the original
                words). Use ellipses (…) to indicate where words were removed from the original
                quotation.
