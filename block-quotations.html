            <h1>Block Quotations</h1>
                           Use a block quote whenever a direct quotation exceeds a certain length
(depending on the citation style being used).
• APA: 40+ words
• MLA: 4+ lines of prose or 3+ lines of verse
Formatting Block Quotations
⇒ Provide an introduction or lead into the quote.
⇒ Begin the block quote on a new line.
⇒ Do not use quotation marks.
⇒ Indent the left margin ½ inch for entire block quote.
⇒ Maintain same spacing as rest of document.
⇒ If quoting verse (poetry), maintain the original line breaks.
⇒ Use a period at the end of the block quote before the parenthetical citation.
⇒ Do not use a period after the parenthetical citation.
Example
Nelly Dean treats Heathcliff poorly and dehumanizes him throughout her narration:
They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room, and I had
no more sense, so, I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it would be gone
on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it crept to Mr.
Earnshaw’s door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber. Inquiries were
made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in recompense for my
cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house. (Bronte 78)
Important Note
When possible, keep direct quotations as brief as possible. Remove unnecessary
portions of the quotation (as long as it does not change the meaning of the original
words). Use ellipses (…) to indicate where words were removed from the original
quotation.
