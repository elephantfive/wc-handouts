            Summaries
A summary is a condensed retelling of a text’s main idea(s) in your own words.
How to Write a Summary
The key to summarizing is to read the text as many times as necessary to
understand it well. You cannot write a strong summary unless you understand the
text.
1. Read, highlight, and annotate the text. Apply these strategies before, during, and
after reading:
2. Create a thesis that includes the title of the text, author(s), and main idea.
a. For example: The article “Global Epidemiology of Mental Disorders: What Are
We Missing” by Baxter, Patton, Scott, Degenhardt, and Whitford (2013) looked
at the mental health needs of different populations around the world and found
that many areas did not have good data.
3. Include all the main ideas from the text. Do not add any ideas or opinions that
were not presented in the original text.
4. Keep the original sequence. Present ideas in the same order as the author’s
ideas.
Before
Reading
• Identify what the text is mainly about based on the
title. In other words, what is the topic?
• Preview the structure and organization of the text.
Are there headings, chapters, or other section
divisions?
During
Reading
• Highlight/underline the key ideas in the text.
• Read the text multiple times.
• Identify the key idea(s) of each paragraph or
section of the text.
After
Reading
• What is the overall idea the author shares about the
topic?
• Does the author make an argument or take a
stance about the topic?
