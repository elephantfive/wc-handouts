            <h1>Punctuation</h1>
Punctuation helps readers interpret the words you’ve written as you intended them to
be interpreted. Punctuation adds clarity and can help express emotion, tone, and
voice.
 APOSTROPHE ( ’ )
Use an apostrophes ( ’ ) to show possession or to indicate letters omitted in the
joining of two words in a contraction.
o do not = don’t
o the ring belongs to Jill = Jill’s ring
o the two boys own a dog = the boys’ dog
 SEMICOLON ( ; )
Use a semicolon ( ; ) to join two complete thoughts or to separate items on a list
that contain commas.
o The situation was hopeless; I couldn’t do anything.
o Mario, my father; Mark, my older brother; Michael, my younger brother; and
Michelle, my sister; all have first names that begin with M.
 COLON ( : )
Use a colon ( : ) at the end of a complete thought to introduce a list, explanation,
or a long quotation. Whatever comes after the colon should explain or describe
the complete thought that came directly before the colon.
o When I went grocery shopping, I picked up a few things: milk, eggs, and
coffee.
o The room was a mess: dirty clothes piled on the floor, wet towels thrown on
the floor, and an empty pizza box tossed in the closet.
o Nelly Dean treats Heathcliff poorly and dehumanizes him throughout her
narration:
o They entirely refused to have it in bed with them, or even in their room, and
I had no more sense, so, I put it on the landing of the stairs, hoping it would
be gone on the morrow. By chance, or else attracted by hearing his voice, it
crept to Mr. Earnshaw's door, and there he found it on quitting his chamber.
Inquiries were made as to how it got there; I was obliged to confess, and in

recompense for my cowardice and inhumanity was sent out of the house.
(Bronte 78)
 PARENTHESES ( )
Use parentheses to enclose asides and afterthoughts or to provide in-text
citations (parenthetical citations). Avoid using parentheses in academic writing to
express asides and afterthoughts. Academic writing should focus on the most
pertinent information.
o I was sure that Ridgefield (the town I’d just visited) was not the place for
me.
o Her name (which I’ve just remembered) was Celestine.
o Romantic poetry is characterized by the "spontaneous overflow of powerful
feelings" (Wordsworth 263).
 DASH ( — )
Use a dash (—) to interrupt a sentence to emphasize, further explain, define a term,
or to make a dramatic shift. Create a dash by pressing the hyphen key twice
immediately before typing the next word (no space between).
o Ramon took our life preserver—our only one—and tossed it far out to sea.
 HYPHEN ( - )
Use a hyphen to join two or more descriptive words that act as a single-word
adjective or phrasal adjective.
o Bill was a smoot-talking charmer.
o The stadium has state-of-the-art scoreboards.
 ELLIPSIS ( … )
Use an ellipsis ( … ) to indicate an omission of words in longer quotations.
o In an essay on urban legends, Jan Harold Brunvand notes that "some individuals make a
point of learning every recent rumor or tale . . . and in a short time a lively exchange of
details occurs" (78).
